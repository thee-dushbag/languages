# Crafting Interpreters <sub><sub>ðŸ« </sub></sub>

This repository is a side track of a book am reading, `crafting interpreters` by `Robert Nystrom`.  
The book uses `java` and `c` to implement a toy, but useful, language called `Lox`. I will use `python` in place of `java`.  
The `python_lox` is the implementation of `Lox` in `python` and `c_lox` in `c`.  
Sample `Lox` source files can be found in the `./src` directory.  
I have chosen the suffix `.lox` to indicate `Lox` source files.

## Languages

- `c`
- `python`

## Progress

Implementations.

- [x] python_lox - `Lox` implementation in `python`.
- [ ] c_lox - `Lox` implementation in `c`.

## Tools Used
- `pytest` - for testing the python implementation of `Lox`
